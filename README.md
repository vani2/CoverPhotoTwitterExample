CoverPhotoTwitterExample
========================

Example of blurred expanding cover photo like twitter app

The Problem is every popular examples show how to create this feature manually in code. Check my example, fully compatible with autolayout, created in Xcode 6 using Swift.

Important
========================
1. I use UIImage category for blurring written on objC.
2. Look carefully into views hierarhy. If you put image view inside scroll view there will be some scroll bugs.
